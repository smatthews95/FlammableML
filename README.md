# FlammableML
Exploration of deep learning tools to estimate flammability parameters for gas mixtures.

## Synthetic Datasets
The large datasets used for training of the machine learning models are generated synthetically using a combination of existing analytical and numerical approaches. 

## Experimental Datasets
*Coming Soon - Aggregated experimental datasets for validation*

## Gas Species
Currently the included data assumes that the mixtures are composed of the following gases:

<u>Gas Species</u>:  
  >*Carbon Dioxide ($CO_{2}$), <br>
  >Carbon Monoxide ($CO$), <br>
  >Hydrogen ($H_{2}$), <br>
  >Methane ($CH_{4}$), <br>
  >Ethylene ($C_{2}H_{4}$), <br>
  >Ethane ($C_{2}H_{6}$), <br>
  >Propylene ($C_{3}H_{6}$), --> Not in Cantera <br>
  >Propane ($C_{3}H_{8}$)*
